## Contributing Guide 101

If you're ready to dive into the codebase and submit new features or bug fixes, this section is for you.

### Overview

#### Internal Contributors (!SHIRO Members)
If you’re part of the !SHIRO GitHub organization and have the privilege to do so, you can work directly on the
repository:
1. Create a new branch from `develop`.
2. Implement your feature or fix in a feature/* branch.
3. Open a Pull Request (PR) back into `develop`.
4. Request a review from another team member before merging.

#### External Contributors
If you’re not part of !SHIRO, we still welcome your contributions!
1. Fork the repository to your own account.
2. Create a new branch in your fork (feature/*).
3. Commit and push your changes.
4. Open a Pull Request from your fork’s branch into the main repo’s `develop` branch.
5. A maintainer will review your changes and provide feedback.

### Style Guide

This project uses the [Google C++ Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html). Please follow the guidelines when contributing.

---

To maintain consistency and readability across the codebase, please adhere to the following conventions:

* **File Naming:** All source and header files (`.hpp`, `.cpp`, `.h`, `.c`) must use **`snake_case`** for their names (
  e.g., `my_awesome_module.hpp`, `parser.cpp`).

* **File Headers (Copyright & License):** Each source file must begin with a short file description header explaining
    its purpose and key details.
    For example:
    ```cpp
    /*
     * File: main.c
     * Description: Entry point for the process initialization.
     */
    ```

    You should also include an SPDX license identifier at the top of any file using comments:

    ```
    SPDX-License-Identifier: LicenseRef-Apache-2.0-NoModNotice
    ```
    
    Optionally, you may include a copyright notice at the top of any file using comments:

    ```
    Copyright (C) Year YourName
    ```
    Note: You don't need to format a copyright notice exactly like this example.
  
    The file description is required for source files, while the license and copyright headers are optional but
    recommended for clarity and attribution.

* **Header Guards:** To prevent multiple inclusions, all header files (`.hpp`) must use include guards. The naming
  convention for these guards should follow the pattern:
  `SHIRO_FILENAME_EXTENSION`

    * **Structure:** `SHIRO_` (prefix) `FILENAME_` (snake_case filename)
      `EXTENSION` (e.g., `H`, `HPP`)

    * **Example for `common.hpp`:**
        ```cpp
        #ifndef SHIRO_COMMON_HPP
        #define SHIRO_COMMON_HPP

        // ... file content ...

        #endif // SHIRO_COMMON_HPP
        ```
      **All definitions should be UPPERCASE.**

* **Commenting:** Do not be afraid to comment. Comments are a great way to explain your code and help others understand
  your code. Comments should be in a place where they are useful and not redundant. **Do not** comment self-explanatory
  code. Feel free to comment on anything but keep it concise and not cluttered. This includes but is not limited
  to:
    * Explain why a particular piece of code is written the way it is.
    * Breakdown and explain how certain parts of the code work.
    * Personal notes and thoughts.
        * Please ensure your comments are complying with [**CODE OF CONDUCT**](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and are
          appropriate for the project. Avoid discriminatory or offensive comments.

* **Naming Conventions:** Function names should be in `PascalCase` (e.g., `MyAwesomeFunction`).
      under any normal circumstances. An exception to this rule is when the function is a getter or setter. In this
      case, the function name should be in `snake_case` (e.g., `get_my_awesome_variable`).

* **Tabs vs. Spaces:** Use spaces for indentation in files. Do not use tabs. See [Google C++ Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html) for more details.

Clang-tidy does not automatically check and correct function names convention. Please ensure that all
function names are adhering to the above conventions.

### Pull Request Checklist

To ensure that your pull request is pass the checks, please ensure that you have completed the following:
- [ ] Your code follows the style guide outlined above.
- [ ] You have signed the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) for all your commits.
- [ ] You have run clang-format and clang-tidy on your code, and it passes all checks.
